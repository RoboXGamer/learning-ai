# React + Vite App

Welcome to this React application powered by Vite! This project aims to provide a minimal setup for getting started with React in Vite, including Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint rules for code quality.

**Vite Plugins**

This project utilizes one of the two official Vite plugins for React, which enable Fast Refresh for a seamless development experience:

1. **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)**: This plugin leverages [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
2. **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)**: This plugin utilizes [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

**Getting Started**

To start the application, run `npm install` to install the dependencies, followed by `npm run dev` to start the development server. The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

**Features**

- Fast Refresh with HMR for efficient development
- ESLint integration for code quality and consistency
- Support for both Babel and SWC for Fast Refresh
